# International Trade Automation

Automating international trade document workflows using W3C Verifiable Credentials and semantic web technologies.

## Overview

This project aims to digitize and automate traditional paper-based international trade processes by:

- Modeling trade documents (KTDDE) using W3C Semantic Web standards
- Representing trade documents as W3C Verifiable Credentials
- Enabling interoperable, machine-readable trade data exchange
- Supporting EU Business Wallet integration

## Technology Stack

- **W3C Semantic Web Stack** - RDF, OWL, RDFS
- **JSON-LD** - JSON-based linked data representation
- **W3C Verifiable Credentials** - Standardized digital credential format
- **OWL Vocabulary** - Custom ontology for KTDDE trade documents

## KTDDE Trade Documents

KTDDE (to be documented) covers key international trade documents including:

- Commercial Invoice
- Bill of Lading
- Certificate of Origin
- Packing List
- (additional documents to be specified)

## Status

🚧 **In Development**

Currently working on:
- OWL vocabulary definition for KTDDE documents
- JSON-LD context mapping
- VC schema design

## EU Business Wallet

This project is designed to work with the upcoming EU Business Wallet (EU regulation proposal November 2025).
